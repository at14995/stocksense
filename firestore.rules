/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Stock Sense Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership for user profiles and public read access for stock data and sentiment analysis.
 * User profiles are secured using path-based ownership, allowing each user to manage their own profile. Stock and sentiment data is publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, with {userId} matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /stocks/{stockId}: Stores stock information.
 * - /stocks/{stockId}/sentimentAnalysis/{sentimentAnalysisId}: Stores sentiment analysis data for stocks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly allowed via public read of /users.
 * - Stock and Sentiment data are publicly readable.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The sentiment analysis documents are located as subcollections of Stocks.
